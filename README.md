# Time Series Forecasting

This is an example of Time Series Forecasting.

## Context

A pharmaceutical distribution company wants to improve its product demand forecasts to optimize its inventories and reduce operational costs. Currently, forecasts are made manually and have not been effective, resulting in both excess inventory and product shortages. As a Senior Data Scientist, you have been asked to develop a demand forecasting model using time series.

## Objective

Develop a demand forecasting model for the next 12 months, based on historical sales data for a specific product. You should use time series techniques to create this model, focusing on the appropriate choice of error metrics and critical analysis of the model's performance against the validation data set. In addition, you should consider factors such as trends, seasonality, and possible anomalies.

## Instructions

1) EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform extensive exploratory analysis of the data, identifying patterns
2) Modeling: Use modeling methods to predict future demand. We recommend considering traditional time series models (such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or ETS, etc.)
3) Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of your model using the following error metrics:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
   - WMAPE (Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error)\
     Explain which metric you consider most appropriate for this type of problem and why.

## Deliverable
